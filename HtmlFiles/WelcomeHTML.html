		<h1>Function Study Project</h1> 
		<p>
		The implementation consists of a graphical interface whose purpose is to read the function inserted in textual form by the user and to show the graph of the inserted function. The system also allows you to view the derived function (of any order) in graphic and textual form. It also gives the possibility to represent several functions at the same time.
