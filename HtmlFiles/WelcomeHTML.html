		<h1>Function Study Project</h1> 
		<h3>This is a university project, done by 5 guys, for the software engineering exam.</h3>
		<p>
		The program can be used both from the command line and through the GUI. If you are using it for the first time, I invite you to visit the "About" section in the "Help" menu to get all the necessary information. For command line users, type the "help" command to access it.<br>
		<h3>About the application</h3>
		The implementation consists of a graphical interface whose purpose is to read the function inserted in textual form by the user and to show the graph of the inserted function. The system also allows you to view the derived function (of any order) in graphic and textual form. It also gives the possibility to represent several functions at the same time.
